# Kmeans-Clusters
# Project Title: Analysis of Prediction of "small_customers.csv"of American mall markets called as phonic small.To find out how many customers are visited to aparticular shop.On basis of this prediction of annual income Versus Spending scores.
# Disclaimers
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as centroid and spending score frome the range 1-100 called as datanodes of cluster.
# Problem Statement
The American finance market as per the GDP of 2011"phonix_trillums"mall as in first range out 5.The owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or products search in different types of clusters in entire mall.

As a data science Engineer predict the futuristic financial for the upcoming gdp rate based on No.of Cluster.The client wants atleast 5 top clusters(shop).

# Conclusion
According to the model basics prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster 1 is in red colour is highest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes.
# Refernce
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spots represents centroids which is max to max only 3.
